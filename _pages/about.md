My research interests lie at the intersection of physics, astronomy, and how imaging can help us understand the universe.

I've had the privilege of working alongside a talented group of researchers to push the boundaries of what is detectable using cutting edge infrared detectors searching for near-Earth objects. My work with NASA's Near-Earth Object Surveyor (NEOS) has been a highlight of my life.

There a few selected publications below, but you can find a full list of my publications above.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
