              RM
              are identified through S1P antagonist CD69 and expression of integrins CD103/β7 and CD49a/CD29(β1). Contrary to the established role of CD69 on CD8 T cells, the functions of CD103 and CD49a on this population are not well defined. This study examines the expression patterns and functions of CD103 and CD49a with a specific focus on their impact on T cell motility during influenza virus infection. We show that the T
              RM
              cell surface phenotype develops by 2 wk postinfection, with the majority of the population expressing CD49a and a subset that is also positive for CD103. Despite a previously established role in retaining T
              RM
              in peripheral tissues, CD49a facilitates locomotion of virus-specific CD8 T cells, both in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that CD49a may contribute to local surveillance mechanisms of the T

            Multicellular rosettes are transient epithelial structures that serve as intermediates during diverse organ formation. We have identified a unique contributor to rosette formation in zebrafish Kupffer’s vesicle (KV) that requires cell division, specifically the final stage of mitosis termed abscission. KV utilizes a rosette as a prerequisite before forming a lumen surrounded by ciliated epithelial cells. Our studies identify that KV-destined cells remain interconnected by cytokinetic bridges that position at the rosette’s center. These bridges act as a landmark for directed Rab11 vesicle motility to deliver an essential cargo for lumen formation, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). Here we report that premature bridge cleavage through laser ablation or inhibiting abscission using optogenetic clustering of Rab11 result in disrupted lumen formation. We present a model in which KV mitotic cells strategically place their cytokinetic bridges at the rosette center, where Rab11-associated vesicles transport CFTR to aid in lumen establishment.},

	abstract = {The depletion region around each p-n junction in HgCdTe HAWAII-2RG detector arrays decreases in volume as charge is collected, causing the pixel capacitance to change continuously throughout an integration period. This changing capacitance manifests as a steadily decreasing measured signal rate while observing a constant ﬂux. Ignoring this nonlinear response to signal accumulation can lead to underestimating the number of detected photons by as much as 10\%. Presented here are two methods, one simple and one complex, of measuring this signal nonlinearity and a theoretical framework behind a nonlinearity correction method. Additionally, experimental data are compared with simulations to explain methods to reduce noise in the nonlinearity measurement and identify deviations from the expected behavior that merit further study.},

	abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) is extensively remodeled during inﬂammation providing essential guidance cues for immune cell migration and signals for cell activation and survival. There is increasing interest in the therapeutic targeting of ECM to mitigate chronic inﬂammatory diseases and enhance access to the tumor microenvironment. T cells utilize the ECM as a scaffold for interstitial migration, dependent on T cell expression of matrix-binding integrins αVβ1/αVβ3 and tissue display of the respective RGD-containing ligands. The speciﬁc ECM components that control T cell migration are unclear. Fibronectin (FN), a canonical RGD-containing matrix component, is heavily upregulated in inﬂamed tissues and in vitro can serve as a substrate for leukocyte migration. However, limited by lack of tools to intravitally visualize and manipulate FN, the speciﬁc role of FN in effector T cell migration in vivo is unknown. Here, we utilize ﬂuorescently-tagged FN to probe for FN deposition, and intravital multiphoton microscopy to visualize T cell migration relative to FN in the inﬂamed ear dermis. Th1 cells were found to migrate along FN ﬁbers, with T cells appearing to actively push or pull against ﬂexible FN ﬁbers. To determine the importance of T cell interactions with FN, we used a speciﬁc inhibitor of FN polymerization, pUR4. Intradermal delivery of pUR4 (but not the control peptide) to the inﬂamed skin resulted in a local reduction in FN deposition. We also saw a striking attenuation of Th1 effector T cell movement at the pUR4 injection site, suggesting FN plays a key role in T cell interstitial migration. In mechanistic studies, pUR4 incubation with FN in vitro resulted in enhanced tethering of T cells to FN matrix, limiting productive migration. In vivo, such tethering led to increased Th1 accumulation in the inﬂamed dermis. Enhanced Th1 accumulation exacerbated inﬂammation with increased Th1 activation and IFNγ cytokine production. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of ECM FN ﬁbrils for T cell migration in inﬂamed tissues and suggest that manipulating local levels of ECM FN may prove beneﬁcial in promoting T cell accumulation in tissues and enhancing local immunity to infection or cancer.},
