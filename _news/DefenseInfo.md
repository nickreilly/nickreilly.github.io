July 30th at 1pm.  Bausch and Lomb Hall rm. 106 on the River Campus:

Bausch and Lomb
500 Wilson Blvd, Rochester, NY 14611

Once you're in the building, look for the signs for 106!  Talk to the parking booth at the Elmwood entrance to campus if you need parking. I think its ~$5 a day, or something like that.  I hope to see you there!  

I will update this page with Zoom information on the day of the defense.

Celebration to follow at the new Cheshire location on Gregory and Clinton, probably some time between 6 and 6:30.  I'm working on food, but probably will have Ethiopian.  If that isn't something you want, bring your own food (or we'll order pizza or something, too).



Here is the Zoom invite:
