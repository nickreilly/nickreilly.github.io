July 30th at 1pm.  Bausch and Lomb Hall rm. 106 on the River Campus: <br/>

Bausch and Lomb <br/>
500 Wilson Blvd, Rochester, NY 14611 <br/>

Once you're in the building, look for the signs for 106!  Talk to the parking booth at the Elmwood entrance to campus if you need parking. I think its ~$5 a day, or something like that.  <br/>

Celebration to follow at the new Cheshire location on Gregory and Clinton, probably around 6:30pm.  See you there! <br/>

Here is the Zoom invite:<br/>
