July 30th at 1pm.  Bausch and Lomb Hall rm. 106 on the River Campus: \n

Bausch and Lomb \n
500 Wilson Blvd, Rochester, NY 14611 \n\n

Once you're in the building, look for the signs for 106!  Talk to the parking booth at the Elmwood entrance to campus if you need parking. I think its ~$5 a day, or something like that.  \n

Celebration to follow at the new Cheshire location on Gregory and Clinton, probably around 6:30pm.  See you there!
